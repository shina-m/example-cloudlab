Programming Assignment 2

==================
Build Instructions
==================
To build the program, run "make" within assignment root directory.


==================
Usage Instructions
==================
To run the program, run "./dvr [Config File Dir]" in the root directory after compiling
e.g "./dvr config/a.txt" for node A

=====
Notes
=====
I used an additional thread for receiving data through the assiged port rather than using timeouts

Assumptions made:  
A maximum of 10 nodes are in the network. 
The host name for each node is only one character.

Config files:
I have 2 set of config files "config/" and "config1/". in "config1/", all the distance between neighbours is set to 1, while in "config/", random values are set. The IP addresses there are valid from what is on my geni machines


Limitations:
The receiving socket only works the first time the program is run on a machine. after that, I have to exit and ssh back into the machine or kill all previous processes on the port to get it working fine again. I tried using SO_REUSEPORT option in my code to solve the problem, but it didn't completely solve the problem.


=======
Results
=======
Based on my tests on all 7 GENI nodes concurrently, everything seems to be working fine
